### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mitchell, a software engineer passionate about creating impactful
contributions to social causes. My journey in the tech world spans across
various languages and technologies, with a focus on Python, Rust, and Go.

## Current interests

- **Type Safety**: I'm a strong advocate for type safety in programming
  languages, as it leads to more robust and reliable software systems.

- **Defensive Architecture**: I'm passionate about designing and implementing
  defensive architectures that prioritize security and resilience, ensuring that
  systems can withstand unexpected threats and challenges.

- **Developer Experience**: I believe in the importance of optimizing the
  developer experience, whether it's through creating intuitive APIs,
  streamlining development workflows, or providing comprehensive documentation.

- **Exploring Embedded Systems with Arduino**: In my free time, I'm diving into
  the world of embedded systems, particularly with Arduino. Learning C has
  become a key focus as I delve into hobby projects involving microcontrollers.
  By mastering C, I aim to unlock the full potential of Arduino, enabling me to
  create innovative solutions for home automation, robotics, and other exciting
  applications. This journey not only fuels my curiosity but also enhances my
  understanding of computer architecture and real-time programming principles.
